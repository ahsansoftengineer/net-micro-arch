## 💡 Suggestion for You

Since you’re building from scratch and want to:

* Schedule **multiple jobs**
* Have full control (scheduling, retries, triggers)
* Avoid commercial/proprietary traps
* Possibly scale in the future

> ✅ Go with **Quartz.NET**
> You can always integrate a custom dashboard later using logs or database monitoring.

* A **starter template** for Quartz.NET with dependency injection?
* Or an example of **defining and scheduling multiple jobs** in .NET Core using Quartz?
