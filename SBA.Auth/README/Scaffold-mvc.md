### Scaffold
- When scaffolding Identity in an ASP.NET Core application using the `dotnet aspnet-codegenerator identity` command, you can include various Identity-related files based on what you need for your application. Here's a list of commonly scaffolded Identity files and what they are used for:

### **Files You Can Include**
1. **Account Management**
   - `Account.Register` - For user registration.
   - `Account.Login` - For user login.
   - `Account.Logout` - For logging out.
   - `Account.ForgotPassword` - For handling password reset requests.
   - `Account.ResetPassword` - For resetting passwords.
   - `Account.Manage` - For managing user profile and account settings.

2. **Password Management**
   - `Account.ChangePassword` - For changing a user's password.
   - `Account.Manage/ChangePassword` - For updating a password from the profile page.

3. **Two-Factor Authentication**
   - `Account.Manage/EnableAuthenticator` - For enabling two-factor authentication (2FA).
   - `Account.Manage/TwoFactorAuthentication` - For managing 2FA settings.
   - `Account.Manage/ResetAuthenticator` - For resetting the authenticator app.

4. **Email Confirmation**
   - `Account.ConfirmEmail` - For confirming the email address of a user.
   - `Account.ResendEmailConfirmation` - For resending the email confirmation link.

5. **External Logins**
   - `Account.ExternalLogin` - For integrating external login providers (e.g., Google, Facebook).

6. **Lockout**
   - `Account.Lockout` - For displaying a lockout page when a user is temporarily locked out.

7. **Error Handling**
   - `Account.AccessDenied` - For handling unauthorized access attempts.
   - `Error` - For generic error handling.

8. **Razor Pages for Account Management**
   - `Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/Manage/Index` - Main page for managing user account settings.

### **Command Example for Including More Files**
You can scaffold multiple files by specifying them as a semicolon-separated list, like this:

```bash
dotnet aspnet-codegenerator identity -dc ApplicationDbContext --files "Account.Register;Account.Login;Account.Logout;Account.ForgotPassword;Account.ResetPassword;Account.ConfirmEmail;Account.Manage"
```

---

### **If You Want All Default Identity UI Pages**
To scaffold all Identity UI pages at once, you can omit the `--files` parameter and run the command like this:

```bash
dotnet aspnet-codegenerator identity -dc ApplicationDbContext
```

---

### **Customizations**
- **Override the Default Identity UI**: Scaffolding all pages allows you to customize the look, feel, and functionality of the Identity system to match your application's requirements.
- **Add Custom Properties**: After scaffolding, you can extend the `IdentityUser` or `ApplicationUser` class to include custom fields (e.g., FirstName, LastName) and modify the UI accordingly.
